## **UX**
I started with Strategy, thinking about who was going to use the website and what their goals would be. 

The target audience for this website is:

* All age groups, both men and female.
* People that want to have a table booked so that they dont have to worry about not getting a table.
* People who like swedish food.

The users will be looking for:

* A website that shows information about the restaurant such as, location, contact and menu.
* The ability to book a table for them and their party.
* The ability to manage their booking.

### <ins>USER STORIES</ins>

- As a **site user** i want to be able to view the menu so that i know what food the restaurant serves.
- As a **site user** i can find information about the restaurant so that i can collect information such as contact information and open times.
- As a **site user** i can create an account so that my bookings are saved to my profile.
- As a **site user** i can login so that i can make reservations.
- As a **site user** i can make reservations so that I'm guaranteed a table.
- As a **site user** i can edit and delete my reservations so that the reservation is flexible.
- As a **site owner** i want users not be able to book if all of our tables are full so that i can avoid double bookings.
- As a **site owner** i want to see all of the reservations for the night so that i can greet the customers and show them to their table.

#### Future Features

* Remove old bookings. 
* Add search bar to the admin reservation page so the restaurant can search for booking numbers or booking names.


## **DATABASE DESIGN**

When creating the project i deployed it to heroku and set up the PostgreSQL database as this is included with heroku.

For creating and storing users i used Djangoâ€™s built in authentication system django.contrib.auth.models.

#### <ins>Tables</ins>

| Key         | Name        | Type        |
|------------ |------------ |------------ |
| Primary Key | Id          | Int         |
|             | table_size  | Int         |


#### <ins>Reservations</ins>

| Key         | Key          | Type          |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | 
| Primary Key | Id           | Int           | 
| Foreign Key | user         | CharField     | 
|             | party_size   | Int           | 
| Foreign Key | table        | Int           | 
|             | book_date    | DateField     |
|             | book_time    | Choices       |
|             | end_time     | Int           |


For the book_time choices i had the following choices: 

        (1050, '17:30'),
        (1065, '17:45'),
        (1080, '18:00'),
        (1095, '18:15'),
        (1110, '18:30'),
        (1125, '18:45'),
        (1140, '19:00'),
        (1155, '19:15'),
        (1170, '19:30'),
        (1185, '19:45'),
        (1200, '20:00'),
        (1215, '20:15'),
        (1230, '20:30'),
        (1245, '20:45'),
        (1260, '21:00'),
        (1275, '21:15'),
        (1290, '21:30'),
        (1305, '21:45'),
        (1320, '22:00'),

The key is an int witch represents the amount of minutes passed until the time (value). For example, 17:30 in minutes is 17*60 + 30 = 1050.

Insted of having to work with time values i could work with integers witch made things a whole lot easier, each booking is for two hours so all i had to do was set the end_time to the book_time + 120. With this structure it also makes the diffrent choices flexible and i could add any time i wanted without facing any problems with the logic.


## **DEPLOYMENT**

The site is hosted on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com)

###  <ins>Github and Gitpod</ins>

To create the repository and develop the project i followed the steps below:

1. Create the Github repository and start development:
  * Install the gitpod addon if not already installed. 
  * Go to your github profile and press the green "New" button.
  * Enter a name and for this project i used the Code Institute Full-template provided by them.
  * Once your repository is created in the top right there should be a green button with the text "Gitpod". Press the button and wait for the build to finish.

The code was commited to Git and pushed to Github using the terminal


### <ins>Deploying on Heroku</ins>

To install the Django framework and deploy this project to heroku i followed the Code institutes [Django Blog cheatsheet](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fst/Django%20Blog%20Cheat%20Sheet%20v1.pdf)
